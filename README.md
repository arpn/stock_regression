# Language model for stock prices

Training a "language model" for multi-variate time-series data: historical price action of S&P-500 stocks. The model is an encoder-only transformer architecture. Draws inspiration from cs/2010.02803. Working towards a multi-modal CLIP-like model for stock price action.
